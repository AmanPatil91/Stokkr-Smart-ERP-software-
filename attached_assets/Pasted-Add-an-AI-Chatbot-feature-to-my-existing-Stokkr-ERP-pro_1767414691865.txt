Add an AI Chatbot feature to my existing Stokkr ERP project.

Important:
- Do NOT modify database schemas
- Do NOT change business logic, accounting logic, or workflows
- The chatbot must be strictly read-only
- The chatbot must work both on Replit and when running locally

Goal:
Provide a conversational Business Insights Assistant that explains existing business data in natural language.

Architecture & Behavior:

1. Chatbot Role:
- Acts as a Business Insights Assistant
- Explains data, trends, and summaries
- Must NOT make decisions, approvals, or data changes

2. Supported Questions:
The chatbot should answer queries such as:
- “What are my sales this month?”
- “Summarize expenses for this month”
- “Why did profit change compared to last month?”
- “Which customers have the highest outstanding?”
- “What products are low in stock?”
- “Why is cash lower than profit?”

3. Data Access Rules:
- Use only existing derived data from:
  - Profit & Loss
  - Cash Flow
  - Receivables & Payables
  - Expenses
  - Inventory summaries
- Fetch data only through existing backend APIs or service functions
- Must NOT query the database directly

4. Explanation Logic:
- Convert numeric data into clear, human-readable explanations
- Compare current period vs previous period when relevant
- Highlight key contributors (top expenses, overdue customers, sales trends)

5. UI Integration:
- Add a Chatbot panel under the “Business Insights Assistant” section on the Home page
- Provide:
  - Text input for user questions
  - Scrollable chat history
  - Clear visual distinction between user messages and AI responses

6. Safety & Guardrails:
- Clearly label responses as informational / AI-generated
- No write operations or side effects
- No enforcement or automation
- If data is unavailable, respond gracefully with guidance

7. Local Compatibility:
- Load AI API keys from environment variables
- Do NOT hardcode secrets
- Ensure the chatbot functions when the project is run locally

Outcome:
Enable users to understand business performance through conversational explanations while preserving data integrity and portability.
