Implement a General Ledger (GL) feature in my existing Stokkr ERP project that can be reviewed period-wise.

Goal:
Provide a read-only, double-entry General Ledger that records all financial transactions and allows review by month and financial year.

Requirements:

1. Ledger Entries:
- Automatically generate ledger entries for existing transactions:
  - Sales invoices
  - COGS on sale
  - Customer payments
  - Inventory purchases (batches)
  - Supplier payments
  - Expense entries
  - Interest and tax-related entries
- Each transaction must create balanced debit and credit entries
- Ledger entries must reference their source records (invoiceId, batchId, expenseId, paymentId)

2. Period-wise Review:
- Allow filtering the General Ledger by:
  - Month & Year (e.g., March 2025)
  - Full Financial Year (e.g., Apr 2024 – Mar 2025)
- Default view should be current month
- Ledger data should recalculate dynamically based on selected period

3. Ledger Accounts:
Support standard ledger accounts such as:
- Cash / Bank
- Accounts Receivable
- Accounts Payable
- Inventory
- Sales
- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
- Expenses (category-wise)
- Interest Expense
- Tax Payable

4. General Ledger UI:
- Create a General Ledger page under Analytics / Dashboard
- Provide filters:
  - Ledger Account (dropdown)
  - Period selector (Month / Year)
- Display columns:
  - Date
  - Description
  - Debit
  - Credit
  - Running Balance (within selected period)

5. Rules:
- Ledger must be read-only (no manual edits)
- Ledger is derived from existing transactions and is not the source of truth
- Historical entries must not be modified
- Ensure debit total equals credit total for every transaction

6. Export:
- Allow exporting the period-wise General Ledger to CSV

Constraints:
- Do NOT refactor existing invoice, inventory, expense, P&L, or cash-flow logic
- Add minimal schema changes only if required
- Reuse existing date and period selection patterns
- Add clear comments explaining debit/credit logic

Outcome:
The General Ledger should allow accountants and auditors to review all transactions accurately on a monthly or yearly basis, similar to industry ERP systems.
