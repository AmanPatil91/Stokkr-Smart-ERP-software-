Create a Party Performance Summary feature in my existing Stokkr ERP project.

Important:
- Do NOT modify database schemas
- Do NOT refactor invoice, payment, or receivable/payable logic
- This feature must be derived, read-only, and analytical only

Goal:
Provide a consolidated performance view for each customer and supplier to support distributor operations and credit decisions.

Requirements:

1. Party Scope:
- Support both Customers and Suppliers
- Allow filtering by:
  - Party type (Customer / Supplier)
  - Month and Year
- Default view = current month

2. Metrics to Display (Derived):

For Customers:
- Total Sales:
  Sum of invoice taxable values for the selected period
- Outstanding Balance:
  Sum of unpaid invoice balances
- Average Payment Delay:
  Average number of days between invoice date and payment date
  (For unpaid invoices, calculate delay till current date)

For Suppliers:
- Total Purchases:
  Sum of purchase/batch values for the selected period
- Outstanding Payables:
  Sum of unpaid supplier balances
- Average Payment Delay:
  Average number of days between purchase date and payment date
  (For unpaid payables, calculate delay till current date)

3. Calculation Rules:
- All metrics must be computed dynamically from existing invoices, batches, and payments
- No manual edits allowed
- Exclude GST from sales and purchase totals

4. UI:
- Add a “Party Performance” view under Dashboard / Analytics
- Display data in a sortable table with columns:
  - Party Name
  - Total Sales / Purchases
  - Outstanding Balance
  - Avg Payment Delay (days)
- Use color indicators:
  - Green → healthy
  - Yellow → moderate delay
  - Red → high delay

5. Export:
- Allow CSV export of the Party Performance Summary for the selected period

6. Safety Rules:
- Read-only view only
- No enforcement or blocking logic
- No changes to existing workflows

Outcome:
Provide distributor-friendly visibility into customer and supplier behavior to support credit management and operational decisions.
