Add a Monthly Cash Flow Statement feature to my existing Stokkr ERP project.

Important Context:
- P&L already uses COGS (accrual-based accounting)
- Cash Flow must be calculated only from actual cash movements
- Cash Flow logic must remain independent from P&L logic

Requirements:

1. Month & Year Selection:
- Provide selectors for Month and Year
- Default selection = current month and year (live system date)
- Recalculate cash flow dynamically when selection changes

2. Cash Flow Structure (monthly):

A. Cash from Operating Activities:
Include only actual cash movements within the selected month:
- Cash received from customers (invoice payments received in the selected month)
- Cash paid for operating expenses in the selected month
Exclude:
- Credit sales without payment
- Unpaid receivables
- Inventory purchases unless recorded as cash payments

Formula:
Net Operating Cash Flow =
Cash received from customers − Cash paid for expenses

B. Cash from Financing Activities:
Include transactions within the selected month:
- Loan amounts received
- Loan repayments
- Interest paid

C. Cash from Investing Activities:
- Exclude or display as zero

D. Net Cash Flow:
Net Cash Flow =
Net Operating Cash Flow + Net Financing Cash Flow

3. UI:
- Display the statement in a clean, accounting-style table
- Sections:
  - Cash from Operating Activities
  - Cash from Financing Activities
  - Net Cash Flow
- Place under Dashboard / Analytics
- Format currency values clearly

4. Export:
- Allow exporting the monthly Cash Flow Statement to CSV

Rules:
- Cash Flow must reflect only cash movement within the selected month
- Profit or loss values must NOT appear in cash flow
- Credit sales affect cash flow only when payment is received

Constraints:
- Do NOT refactor existing invoice, receivable, payable, expense, or P&L logic
- Use existing payment and expense records only
- Add minimal helper logic if required
- Comment all calculations clearly

Goal:
The Cash Flow Statement should accurately show how cash moved during the selected month and year, independent of profitability.
