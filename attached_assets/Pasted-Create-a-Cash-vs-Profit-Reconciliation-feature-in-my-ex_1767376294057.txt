Create a Cash vs Profit Reconciliation feature in my existing Stokkr ERP project.

Important:
- Do NOT refactor existing Profit & Loss or Cash Flow logic
- Do NOT add new database tables
- This feature must be derived, read-only, and for analysis only

Goal:
Explain why Net Profit and Net Cash Flow differ for a selected period.

Requirements:

1. Period Selection:
- Allow selecting Month and Year
- Use the same period selector as P&L and Cash Flow
- Default to current month

2. Base Values (Derived):
- Net Profit:
  Use existing Profit & Loss calculation for the selected period
- Net Cash Flow:
  Use existing Cash Flow calculation for the same period

3. Reconciliation Components:
Derive and display the following reconciling items:

a) Credit Sales Impact (Receivables):
- Increase in accounts receivable during the period
- Explanation: Sales recorded as profit but cash not yet received

b) Outstanding Payables Impact:
- Increase or decrease in accounts payable during the period
- Explanation: Expenses or purchases recorded but cash not yet paid

c) Inventory Impact:
- Difference between inventory purchased and COGS recognized
- Explanation: Cash spent on inventory not yet sold

d) Loan Principal Movements:
- Loan principal repayments or receipts
- Explanation: Affects cash flow but not profit

4. Reconciliation Format:
Display reconciliation in a step-by-step format:

Net Profit
+ / − Change in Receivables
+ / − Change in Payables
+ / − Inventory Impact
+ / − Loan Principal Movements
= Net Cash Flow

5. UI:
- Add a “Cash vs Profit Reconciliation” section under Dashboard / Analytics
- Display as a clear table with:
  - Item
  - Amount
  - Short explanation
- Keep layout simple and accountant-friendly

6. Rules:
- All values must be derived from existing data
- No manual adjustments allowed
- No enforcement or blocking logic

7. Export:
- Allow CSV export of the reconciliation for the selected period

Outcome:
Users should clearly understand the difference between profitability and liquidity caused by credit sales, outstanding balances, inventory movements, and loan repayments.
