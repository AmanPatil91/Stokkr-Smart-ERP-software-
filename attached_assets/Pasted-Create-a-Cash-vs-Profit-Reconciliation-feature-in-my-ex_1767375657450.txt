Create a Cash vs Profit Reconciliation feature in my existing Stokkr ERP project.

Important:
- Do NOT refactor existing Profit & Loss or Cash Flow logic
- Do NOT add new accounting tables
- This feature must be derived and read-only

Goal:
Help users understand why Net Profit and Net Cash Flow differ for a selected period.

Requirements:

1. Period Selection:
- Allow selecting Month and Year
- Use the same period selector as P&L and Cash Flow
- Default = current month

2. Data Inputs (Derived):
- Net Profit:
  Use the existing Profit & Loss calculation for the selected period

- Net Cash Flow:
  Use the existing Cash Flow calculation for the same period

3. Reconciliation Breakdown:
Compute and display key reconciling items:

a) Change in Accounts Receivable:
- Increase in receivables due to credit sales
- Explanation: Sales recorded but cash not yet received

b) Change in Accounts Payable:
- Increase or decrease in payables
- Explanation: Expenses or purchases recorded but cash not yet paid

c) Inventory Impact:
- Difference caused by inventory purchased but not sold (COGS vs purchases)

d) Loan & Interest Impact:
- Loan principal affects cash but not profit
- Interest affects profit but not loan balance

4. Reconciliation Logic:
Display reconciliation in the following format:

Net Profit
+ / − Change in Receivables
+ / − Change in Payables
+ / − Inventory Impact
+ / − Loan Principal Movements
= Net Cash Flow

5. UI:
- Add a “Cash vs Profit Reconciliation” section under Dashboard / Analytics
- Display as a simple table or step-by-step breakdown
- Use clear labels and short explanations for each adjustment

6. Rules:
- All values must be derived from existing data
- No manual adjustments allowed
- Keep calculations transparent and well-commented

7. Export:
- Allow CSV export of the reconciliation for the selected period

Outcome:
Users should clearly understand why profitability and liquidity differ for a given month, similar to real-world financial analysis used by accountants and management.
